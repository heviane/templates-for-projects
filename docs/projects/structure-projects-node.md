## Explanations

**public/**: Contains the public resources of your application, accessible by the browser. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files are organized within this folder.

**public/index.html**: The main page of your application.

**public/css/**: Stores CSS files. Keeping styles separate facilitates maintenance.

**public/js/**: Contains client-side JavaScript files. For example, main.js could be the entry point for front-end scripts.

**public/img/**: Stores all project images.

**src/**: Backend.

**src/server/**: Contains files related to the Node.js server. For example, app.js would be the main file for your Node.js application.

**node_modules/**: Directory where Node.js dependencies are installed. This directory is generated automatically by npm.

**package.json**: Node.js configuration file containing information about the project and its dependencies.

**.gitignore**: List of files and folders to be ignored by the Git version control system.

This structure provides a clear separation between front-end and back-end, making project maintenance and organization easier. Be sure to adapt as needed based on the specific requirements of your project.
