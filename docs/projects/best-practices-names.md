# Best practices for directory and file names

## Directory Names

1. **Camel Case:** Use the camel case convention for directory names. Example: `myDirectory` instead of `my_directory` or `my-directory`.

2. **Descriptive and Concise:** Choose names that are descriptive, clearly indicating the purpose of the directory.

## File Names

1. **Camel Case for Modules:** Use camel case to name files containing JavaScript modules. Example: `myModule.js` instead of `my_module.js` or `my-module.js`.

2. **Descriptive and Concise:** Choose file names that are descriptive and clearly indicate the content.

3. **Index.js for Main Modules:** When a directory contains a main module, name it `index.js` for direct referencing.

## Hierarchical Structure

1. **Organize by Functionality:** Group related files in directories representing specific functionality.

2. **Avoid Generic Names:** Avoid generic names like `utils` for directories unless the content is truly generic.

## Consistency

1. **Standardize Naming:** Maintain consistency in file and directory naming.

2. **Avoid Confusing Abbreviations:** Steer clear of abbreviations that may be confusing. Prefer clarity over brevity.
